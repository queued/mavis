# Contribute :book:

## Guidelines
To start contributing, your code **MUST** follow the [PSR 2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) for coding and the [PSR 4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) namespacing standards.

Also, you **MUST NOT** include your own configurations. This will keep your personal data safe and, prevent a headache from cleaning the mess you may have made.

## How to contribute
1. Write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), explain what your patch does, and why it is should be merged.
2. Just [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle): Any patch that changes a lot of code or is difficult to understand should be discussed before you put in the effort.
3. Create an issue, describing the contribution you'd like to make. This will help us to get you started on the right foot.
4. Fork the project in your account and create a new branch: `your-great-feature`.
5. Commit your changes in that branch.
6. Write some tests *(place them inside the `tests` folder)* to ensure the expected behavior on a *few* different situations.
6. Open a pull request and reference the initial issue in the pull request message.
